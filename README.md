# Body-Area-Network-for-Swollen-Vaircose-Veins-Detection-and-Automated-Treatment
This project focuses on developing a smart healthcare system using a Body Area Network (BAN) to detect and treat swollen varicose veins. Varicose veins occur when blood pools in the veins due to weak or damaged valves, causing swelling and pain, especially in the legs.

The system uses wearable sensors such as pressure sensors, temperature sensors, and blood flow monitors to continuously collect real-time data from the patient’s leg area. This data is analyzed using an on-body microcontroller with built-in AI algorithms to detect signs of varicose vein swelling early.

Once abnormal symptoms are detected, the system automatically triggers a non-invasive treatment method. This could include smart compression sleeves, thermal patches, or low-level laser therapy (LLLT) to reduce swelling and improve blood circulation. Data is wirelessly transmitted to a mobile app or healthcare server via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or Zigbee, allowing remote monitoring by doctors or caregivers.

The system provides a real-time, automated solution to manage varicose veins, reduce complications, and improve patient comfort—especially useful for elderly, diabetic, or post-surgical patients.
